This directory holds files which are not part of the Lima Bean
mudlib, but which have been written by others and are compatible
with the lib.

The incoming/ subdirectory is the correct place to put things
which you would like to be considered for inclusion in the lib.
It is probably a good idea to post to lima.discussion as well,
so people know what is there.
