Ok, here are the files I made for a NEWS_D / bulletin board interface.
They belong in the following directories:

board.c       > /std

followup.c   \
replynote.c   \ all in /cmds/player
delete.c      /
post.c       /

boarddata.c   > /std/body

This interface actually require two changes to external files.
In body.c, add a line

inherit __DIR__ "body/boarddata.c";

And in /obj/secure/mailers/mailer.c, change the function send_news_reply()
to read:

void send_news_reply(string subject, string * text, string * to)
{
    if ( base_name(previous_object()) != NEWSREADER )
         if ( base_name(previous_object()) != "/cmds/player/replynote" )
             error("security: attempted use by: " +
               base_name(previous_object()) + "\n");

    send_mail_message(subject, text, to, 0, 0);
}

I hope this is considered useful. Any comments are appreciated.
