		Communicating With the mud

The Lima mudlib is able to understand a wide range of user input,
which is unlike most other MU*'s which normally require very terse and
specific commands.  However, it is a computer game, not an english professor.
Therefore, while it does its best to understand what you type,
it does have its limits.

The following examples should give you an idea of what is acceptable:

north
go north
go through the window
give the red barin to the old wizard
look through beek's crystal ball
drop the hat.
drop the silver hammer
drop all my zorkmids
trade all my weapons for a magic potato
ask the urchin about his jacket

Some points to keep in mind:

o Always use lower case letters for entering input.
o Use adjectives to distinguish between like objects.
  For example,if you see a red book and a green book, and use "get book"
  it will NOT assume for you, but will ask you to specify unambiguously
  which one you mean.
  If you use "a" or "any" (eg "get a book") it will choose randomly,
  and you may get the "wrong" one.

If there is any input you think the mud should accept and does not,
please use the idea command.
