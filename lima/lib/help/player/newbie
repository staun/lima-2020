                           Welcome to Zork MUD!!!
 
   If you are new to the world of mudding, this document should help you 
 get on your way.  If you are a veteran, or simply experienced with Muds,
 you may as well bypass this document all together.  :-)
 
  * What is a MUD?
    + The term "MUD" stands for "Multi-User Dungeon", or "Domain."  It
      is a world created for people everywhere to role-play in different
      genres with people all over the world, as if they were in the same
      room.  (Usually a room which only exists in fantasy or sci-fi.)
 
  * What do I have to do?
    + All that is required of you, the player, is to simply have fun.
      Wander around, explore, play the game, and chat with other players.
      Just think of a Mud as any other role playing game.  Improve your
      character, perform daring deeds, experience adventure, and interact
      with other characters who are simply doing exactly what you are.
 
  * How do I do something?
    + Well, quite simply, just do it.
    + Movement:
      - If you want to wander south, just type "south".  This works for all
        compass directions, as well as "up" and "down".
    + Examining your environment:
      - If you want to see the room you're in, and its contents, "look", or
        if you want to look AT or IN something, use "look at/in".
    + Communication:
      - Player characters (other real life users like yourself) speak to
        each other on the MUD, and will eventually speak to YOU.  If they
        don't, and you want to butt in anyway... (Yeah, you guessed it,
        "say Hello." or "tell bob Hi there!" or "shout Hello Mudders!"
        but without the double quotes.) 
    + Actions:
      - Want something?  Then "take/get" it.  Don't want in anymore?
        Then  "drop" it.  Other actions are often defined for particular
        situations or objects, like "tie rope," "pull lever," "kill monster."
        Funny how art imitates life, eh?  Want to show the world you're
	Type help actions for more on this topic.
    + Emotion or Soul commands:
      - Are you happy and damn proud of it?  Then "smile" or "smile mary" if
        you are happy with her.  (type "feelings" to see what you can do).
    + Help:
      - Overall, if you're confused, ask around, someone's bound to help.
        People are generally friendly and social, and were once totally new
        to muds just like you are.
 
  * Rules:
    + As a player here, you are responsible for knowing the rules.  Type
      "help rules" to see what they are.  Type "help topics" to get a list
      of what you can find out from the help documents.  With all this, you
      will quickly be on your way to adventuring in the addictive world of
      MUDs.  Congratulations!
