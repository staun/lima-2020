Right now, becoming a wizard on the MUD has no firm requirements.

NOTE:  A strong knowledge of the theme is ESSENTIAL as is
a strong familiarity with this mud.  More time spent is advantageous,
since as time progresses, you will hopefully get to know members of the
administration well enough that they will come to trust you as a person.
This is the most important "requirement" -- trust.  Beyond that, a
strong knowledge of LPC is helpful, but by no means required.  And the
time to give a whole-hearted commitment is also pretty important.  Any
time you feel like you have earned a wizardship here under these
guidelines, mail the administration with an application based on this
document.  This document is subject to change due to changing mud
conditions.
