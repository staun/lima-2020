Conferencing is possible through the moderation facilities of channels.
The "conf" channel and alias are available for conferences, although
any channel can actually be moderated.

Channels have a few extra commands available when they are being
moderated:

chan conf		- shows the moderator, the current speaker, and
			  whether your hand is raised to speak.  The
			  moderator will see a list of people with their
			  hands raised.
chan conf /raise	- raise your hand to speak
chan conf /lower	- lower your hand

chan conf /call		- for moderator use: call on the first person in
			  the list of people with raised hands
chan conf /call joe	- for moderator use: call on joe to speak (joe
			  must have his hand raised)

chan conf /moderate	- for admin and moderator group member use: begin
			  moderating a particular channel


The current speaker and the moderator are the only people allowed to
communicate over the channel (using normal messages, emotes, etc.).
