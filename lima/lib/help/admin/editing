This is probably Lima Bean specific, but may be a useful document on other
MUDs despite that.  The following are a (not exhaustive) things we would like
you to keep in mind while editing mudlib code:

(1) try not to break things.

Accidents happen, but, in general, someone who logs on after you've been
working on something should find *most* things in working order.
If you are working on something that is used fairly often,
*be careful*.  Work on a copy in your directory before installing
if necessary.

(2) didlog *everything*

Use the 'I' command.  Even if you think a change is insignificant, log
it anyway.  This not only helps other coders keep track of what has happened,
in the event that something breaks (see (1)) it helps people know where to
look to fix it [and who to blame! :=)]  This can be the difference between
a Minor Disaster [tm] and a Major Disaster [tm].

(3) respect the original authors of the code you are editing

Even if you are fixing something that is "obviously broken", the person
who wrote the code may be aware of this, and have ideas on how it should
be fixed.  In general, if you are making changes to someone else's code, you
should at least run the ideas past them first.  Most of the time you'll get
a "ff" (showemote ff), but it's good to ask just in case they had something
else in mind.
