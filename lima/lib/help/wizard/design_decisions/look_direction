At one point in the past, Lima did in fact have a "look <direction>" verb,
which showed the short description of the next room in that direction much
like many MUDs and mudlibs do.

The problem with this is the output is usually wrong, and often nonsensical:

---
You are standing in the middle of a large plain.

> look east
You are standing towards the east side of a large plain.
There is a small rock here.
Sunning itself on the small rock is a pretty little lizard.
---

The first sentence is downright wrong; as is the second.  The last sentence
implies pretty impressive eyesight, especially if the "scale" of the plain
is large, like hundreds of feet/room as is typical in an outdoor setting.

Furthermore, exits may twist around, etc, so looking in a particular
direction may not even be possible!

After much thought, support for that non-feature was removed.  It is
our general opinion that the "correct" way to do this sort of thing is
to allow exits (or possibly directions) to have long descriptions so
people can in fact look in arbitrary directions.  That has not been
implemented yet, though.
