The Lima Mudlib doesn't support the notion of "hiding" that is found
in many historical mudlibs.  Our view is simply that you can never
plug all the holes (see wizzes_can_dest_admins).  Therefore, we
haven't bunged up the whole mudlib trying to make hiding work.

Second, we simply don't believe in the concept of hiding.  The whole
notion of a wizard hiding from players or other wizards, or even worse
admins hiding from people is anathema to the types of muds that the
Lima team would like to see.  Our view is that a wizard should always
be available to help a player and that an admin should always be there
to help players and wizards.  Hiding is simply anti-social which we
feel engenders the wrong types of attitudes that a successful mud
should embody.
