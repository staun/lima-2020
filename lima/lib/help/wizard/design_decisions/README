This directory is for topics which are asked about on a regular basis, but
have long, complicated answers which are a real pain to explain each time.

The files in this directory are intended to explain why certain things are
the way they are in the Lima lib.  The purpose is not always to assert that
a particular way of doing things is the best or only way of doing things,
but to let people know that we are aware that there are other ways of doing
these things, but we have chosen to do them the way we have for a reason.

Please be aware that in many (in fact, most) cases, these issues have
been discussed to death on here, and in some cases the admins may not
be particularly interested in continuing the discussion with everyone
who disagrees, unless they have thought of some new angle or insight.

The name of the directory is important; this is the way we *decided* to
do certain things.  The fact that these things are decisions implies that
there are other valid ways of doing these things.  Feel free to implement
them on your MUD.
