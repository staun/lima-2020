ADDING A QUEST:

Quest points should be given at any stage of your area or quest that is 
a challenge to get to.  To grant points, you must first tell an admin what
file will grant the points. Then, in that file, make the following call:

QUEST_D->grant_points(solver,quest) 
Where solver is probably going to be this_body(), and quest will be a string
given to you by your admin.  

You should submit requests for adding quests to the game often, don't
be afraid to do that.  However, I would recommend submitting several
requests at once, instead of doing them all one at a time, to make
life easier on your friendly admins.

To view all the quest points available on the mud, use the admtool command.
