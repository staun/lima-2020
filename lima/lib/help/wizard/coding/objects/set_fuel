Set_Fuel()

Set_Fuel() takes an integer as an argument.
That represents the amount of time a 
light source can stay lit, i.e. eventually
it will burn out.  In your objects
create(), have the following function:

     set_fuel(9999)

Also make sure you inherit M_LIGHTABLE, as 
this is where most of the work for your
light source is done at.
