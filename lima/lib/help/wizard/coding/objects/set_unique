Unique Objects

This function tells the mudlib that your 
object is unique.(however at this time
I don't think that it will stop more
than one copy from being in the mud).
What it does do is force the mud to refer 
to your object as "the xxxx" instead of
"a xxxx", implying only one exists.  To
set your object as unique put the 
following function in your objects
create().

    set_unique(1)


The 1 tells the mud its unique, the
default is 0.
