Setup_Door()

The setup for a door is really easy to do.
Most of the work is done for you by
inheriting DOOR, in your object.  What you
need to do is tell the mud a unique name 
for your door, and what direction/wall it 
will be on.  This is done by adding the
following function into your create():

    setup_door("Large Metal Door", dir)


dir is an argument that is passed into the 
door through the create(), your create 
should look like this 

    void create(string dir) 


One other thing that needs to be done is 
not in the door itself, but in the room 
that the door will be in.  In order to 
get the direction to be passed into the 
create of your door, you must give
the direction as an argument to 
set_objects() in the room. As an example

  set_objects((["path_to_my_door":({"west"}) ]) );


By doing the above, your door will be 
in the west wall of the room.
