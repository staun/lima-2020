Set_text()

To make an object have text that is 
readable, you must inherit M_READABLE, 
and have the following function in your
object's create():

    set_text("This is what the player"
             "will see when they type"
             "read object.\n")

You can do much more complicated things by inheriting BOOK;
M_READABLE is for simple objects like a sign etc.  BOOK already inherits 
 M_READABLE and adds some additional functionality for you.  Please 
see the as of now non-existant help on the BOOK inheritable.
