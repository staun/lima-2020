In Room Description

To give your object an intersting desc
when in a room you want to use the 
following function in your objects
create():

    set_in_room_description("$N $vsit here waiting to be picked up")

The string you supply here can be anything.
The $N is the objects id, and the $v will show
the correct form of sit. (see the help on
the message module for more on how this works.)
