Set_Relations()


In order to use set_relations you must
inherit COMPLEX_CONTAINER. Set_realtions()
tells the mud what relations your 
container can have. In your objects 
create():

    set_relations("on"."under");

By doing this you can both put things 
on and under your container. 

**** NOTE --  You must also use 
****          set_max_capacity()
