Setting adjectives

This function allows your objects to have
more descriptive id's.  These can be used 
in conjunction with set_id to interact
with your object.  Place set_adj() in your
objects create().

    set_adj("dumb","stupid");


A player can now refer to your object as 
dumb xxxx or stupid xxxxx.
