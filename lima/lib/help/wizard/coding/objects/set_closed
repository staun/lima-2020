        
Set_closed()


You have a door, now how do you tell the
mud that the door should be closed to 
start with?  First thing to do is make
sure that you inherited DOOR, then in
your objects create(), put the following
function:
     
    set_closed(1)

A 1 in this function closes the door, a 0
and the door will be open.
