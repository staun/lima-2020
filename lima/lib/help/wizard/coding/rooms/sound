Adding Sound to your rooms.

  Add something like the following piece of code to your room, outside of your
setup().  This will get called by the parser.


int sound ()
{
  write ("This is an example sound.  Only you are getting this msg, so "
	 "I guess you're \nhearing voices.\n");
  return 1; // Let the parser know the listen was successfull
}
