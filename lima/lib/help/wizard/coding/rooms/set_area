The area

Let's say you have a monster that you want to wander around, but you don't
want him to leave your castle.  Well, the castle is a pretty big area.
We have to tell Lima when we want a room to be in this area. We do this by
picking a name for our area, for example, "my_castle".  Then, we tell the mud
that our room is in that area by adding the following code to the room's
create () function:

    set_area ("my_castle");

Tips:

   Choose a descriptive name for your areas
   Be consistant!  Your area name shouldn't:
       
	  Change spelling
	  Change case
	  etc...
