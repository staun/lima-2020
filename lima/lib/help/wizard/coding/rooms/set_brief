The Brief Description

The brief description should be a couple of words that tell a person very briefly where he is.  The user sees the brief description whenever he enters or otherwise looks at a room.  To set a room's brief description, use set_brief () from the room's create () function:

    set_brief ("Spooky Copse");

Tips:

   Always capitalize all the words of your brief description.
   Try to pick a description that uniquely describes your room.
