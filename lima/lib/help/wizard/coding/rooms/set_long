The Long Description

The long description should be a detailed description of your room.  To set the long description for a room, you use set_long () from your room's create () function.  For example:

    set_long ("Although there is plenty of daylight left, "
              "you wouldn't know it from within this "
              "copse.  The trees stare at you intently.");

Tips:

   Make your long descriptions interesting!
   Don't make them any more than 5 or 6 lines. People want to read good
   descriptions, but they don't want to read TOO much!
