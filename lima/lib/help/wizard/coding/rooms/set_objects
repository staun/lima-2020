Objects

If there is an object in another file that you'd like to have be in your room, you can use the set_objects () call from your room's create function to have an object placed there.  This function has an odd syntax.  Here is an example that will create two torches and a bed:

    set_objects ( ([ "/domains/std/magic_torch" : 2,
                     "/domains/std/bed" : 1,
                   ]) );

If you need to pass args to your objects setup() function here is how you do it:

    set_objects ( ([ "/domains/std/large_oak_door" : ({ "west" }) ]) );

    This will create a door blocking the west wall of your room.

If you need to pass args and have more than one of the objects in the room, here is an example:

    set_objects ( ([ "/domains/std/foobar" : ({ 3, "west" }) ]) );

    this will create 3 foobars passing each one of them west as an argument.
