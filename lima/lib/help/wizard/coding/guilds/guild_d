guild help version 1.0


void set_guild_title( string name, string title );

The title of the guild, for example "Guild of Thieves".  If you are using the STOCK_GUILDMASTER base class, don't prepend the word "the".


void set_guild_banned( string name, string array banned );

If a player belongs to one of the guilds on the banned list, then stop them from becoming a member of this guild. if "all" is listed, then the guild is the only one the can belong to besides those that are listed as prerequisites or allies.


void set_guild_prereq( string name, string array prereq );

Player must belong to guilds on the prereq list before joining this guild. If guild_need_all is set, then all guilds on the prereq list must be belonged to prior to joining; otherwise any one will do.


void set_guild_allies( string name, string array allies );

Guilds that are able to enter the guild, use trainers, etc.


void set_guild_exclusive( string name, string array exclusive );

A player's guilds may not have attributes listed if they are allowed to join. The exceptions are guilds which are on the prereq and ally lists.


void set_guild_attributes( string name, string array attributes );

A guilds attributes should describe what makes it that guild.
No attributes are specified: these are up to your mud.
(there may be a fun implimented in GUILD_D so that you can specify allowable attributes sometime )


void set_guild_begone( string name, int begone );

What happens when a player leaves the guild from npcs that belong to the guild.
 The range is 0-3. 0 means that all record of a player having been recorded is removed, 1 means that ex-membership is noted, but reentry is allowed. 2 means that reentry isn't allowed, and 3 means that npcs are hostile to the player.


void set_guild_suspend_level( string name, int suspend_level );

1 may use training but not advance guild levels, 2 may not use any facilities.


void set_guild_prospectus( string name, string prospectus );

Text to sell the guild to the player.


void set_guild_sees_secret( string name, int sees_secret );

If sees_secret is not set, then guilds with is_secret set will not be checked for their attributes against the secret list. They will still, however, be checked against the banned list. However if sees_secret is not set, or if they are not explicitly listed, then a banned "all" will not catch a guild.


void set_guild_is_secret( string name, int is_secret );

Guilds with this set won't have their attributes checked against a guild's exclusive list, nor will they be caught by a banned "all" unless seces_secret is set.


void set_guild_need_all( string name, int need_all );

A guild with this set must havew all prerequisites filled to be joined.




string query_guild_title( string name );
string array query_guild_banned( string name );
string array query_guild_prereq( string name );
string array query_guild_allies( string name );
string array query_guild_exclusive( string name );
string array query_guild_attributes( string name );
int query_guild_begone( string name );
int query_guild_suspend_level( string name );
string query_guild_prospectus( string name );
int query_guild_sees_secret(string name);
int query_guild_is_secret(string name);
int query_guild_need_all(string name);

All of the above retrieve the relevant data based on the guild's name.


void guild_add( string name )

This function must be called to create a guild. the set and query functions will bug out unless this is done first.


void guild_remove( string name )

call this to remove a guild (surprise! :)


mixed guild_is_ok( string name, string array player_guilds )

call to process player's guilds versus guildmaster's guilds
Probably shouldn't ever be needed to overloaded.


void define_from_file(string fname)

The file should contain filled guild templates.
These consist of:
* Lines beginning with # are comments.
* White space.
* <keyword> = <value>

The first keyword for each guild must always be "name"
The other keywords are: "prospectus", "begone", "suspend_level", "attributes", "attributes", "exclusive", "allies", "prereq", "banned", "title", "sees_secret", "is_secret", and "need_all"

these all function as the appropriate set function. set functions which would takew an array (for example "attributes") should have their values separated with commas.

An admtool interface will be added shortly.
example files are in /data/config/ - guild-spec and stock-guilds.

comments suggestions etc to --OH or DB.
