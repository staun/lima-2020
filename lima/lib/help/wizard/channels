For wizards, there are a few extra capabilities in the channel system.
These focus around creating the channels.  After the /new you may place
options for that channel:

chan name /new [admin | wiz | wizard | permanent | nopermanent | goaway ]*

The options are:

   admin	- Make the channel an admin channel.  This is only usuable
		  by an admin.
   wiz
   wizard	- Make the channel only usable by wizards.  Only wizards
		  may use this option.

   permanent	- Make the channel permanent.  This channel will remain,
		  even when the last listener goes away.  Mainly, this
		  means that nobody will ever have to do a /new again.
		  This is only usable by an admin.

   nopermanent
   goaway	- The channel can go away when there are no more listeners.
		  This is only usable by an admin.

Even after a channel has been created, you may use /new again to change
the options on the channel.
