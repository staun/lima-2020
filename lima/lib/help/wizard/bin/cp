USAGE:  cp  source destination

   This command will allow you to copy files from source to 
destination.  The source file must exist, the destination may or 
may not exist at the time of the copy.  If the destination does 
not exist one will be created, if the destination does exist, at 
the time of the copy it will be overwritten.

If you do not supply a full path name cp will assume that the 
files will be in your current directory.

cp wizroom.c workroom.c

I will now have a copy of wizroom.c named workroom.c in the 
  current directory.

cp /domains/std/wizroom.c /wiz/zifnab/workroom.c

I now have a copy of wizroom.c in my home directory named workroom.c
