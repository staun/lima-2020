Usage: quest [-a <quest:value:filename>] [-d <quest>] [quest1] [quest2]

Without an argument shows a list of all quest points currently in place.
The a and d flags may be used by admins only to add new quests
or remove old ones.  The a flag overwrites an existing quest if
there is a desire to change it.  You can add and/or delete
multiple quests in the same command by invoking the relevent flag
multiple times, however, 'quest -d foo bar' will not delete a
quest named bar, it will delete foo then show you the quest info
on bar as if you had typed only: 'quest bar'. 'quest -d foo -d bar'
would work, as would 2 seperate uses of the quest command.

Quest points should be given at any stage of your area or quest that is
a challenge to get to.  To grant points, you must first have an
admin add the points with this command, then in the filename
with the permission to grant the points, you must call:
QUEST_D->grant_points(solver,quest)\n Where solver is
probably going to be this_player().  QUEST_D is defined in mudlib.h

Quests in the sense refered to by this command are any milestones
achieved in the course of questing.  All milestones worthy of granting points
are considered individual quests.  You should submit requests for adding
quests to the game often, don't be afraid to do that.  However,
I would recommend submitting several requests at once, instead
of doing them all one at a time, to make life easier on your friendly
ZorkMud admins.
