USAGE: last [-s] [-n count] [-d days] [-D days] [user1 user2 ...]

  -s       : be "silent" -- trim headers, displaying just the data
  -n count : only display this many users (the most recent)
  -d days  : display users logged in WITHIN this many days
  -D days  : display users logged in OLDER than this many days

  user...  : display login information for these users

Note that the options can be combined, but you'll get an error if you
use -d and -D to, say, ask for all users logged in during the past 30
days and those logged in before 60 days ago.

For each user found, their name is displayed followed by when they
logged in (if they are still on) or when they logged out, followed by
where they connected from.
