USAGE: set [variable [value]]

Used by itself, set lists all environment variables which have been set.

With just a variable name as an argument, set will set the value of that
environment variable to "".

If given a second argument, a value, a variable is created with that name and
that value if it doesn't exist.  If it already exists, the old value is
replaced with the new one.

Some of the possible environment variables are:
PROMPT - your prompt.  If you don't change it, it defaults to:   >

ansi   - determines whether or not you see colors.  Some screens aren't 
	 capable of seeing ansi colors, and see gibberish instead.

MORE   - when you're looking at a lot of text at one time (like a big
	 long mail message), this value determines how many lines
	 the game shows you at once.  If you don't set this, it 
	 defaults to 20.

You can use variables you set in your commands.  For example, if you do:

	set victim rust

and then do:
	kill $victim

It's the same as doing:
	kill rust

You can even do:
	alias kv kill $victim

and when you type kv, the mud will look at what you have 'victim'
currently set to.
