Every night, a daemon scans the mudlib for certain comments, and uses them
to build help files in /help/autodoc.  Comments which start in the first
column, and begin with //: are recognized as special (//### is an exception;
it is recognized too).  The following explains what the various types of
comments are, and what they do:

(1) //### This needs to be fixed ...

This adds a line to the file /help/autodoc/FIXME/module, where 'module' is
the last component of the filename the comment was found it.

(2) //:MODULE
    //This modules does ...

The comments after the first line will be put in the file
/help/autodoc/modules/module, where 'module' is the same as above.

(3) //:COMMAND
    //This command does ...

Same as //:MODULE, but /help/autodoc/command/ is used.

(4) //:HOOK foo
    //The "foo" hook ...

These are put in /help/autodoc/hook/foo.  A line is added specifying which
file calls this hook.  (E.g. "Called by /std/sword.c")

(5) //:FUNCTION foo <or> //:FUNC foo

These are put in /help/autodoc/functions/module/foo, where 'module' is the
same as above, and 'foo' is the name of the function being documented.

(6) //:TODO This needs to be done

This works just like the //:### FIXME except it should be used for
items pertaining directly to this mud.  Its purpose is to separate the
things we WANT to do when we have extra time from the things that just
need to be fixed.

(7) //:LIMA
    // I added blah blah to do blah blah because blah
    // --Vette March 8, 1997
    // (keep blank line to make these readable)

These are put in /help/autodoc/lima/foo.  Works like module but
all the comments from one file are placed into one file, thus you can
have multiple LIMA comments in one file and they are all placed
into only one file.
The purpose of this tag is for you to quickly track down changes you
made to the base mudlib for your mud.  If performed with diligence,
will allow MUCH easier upgrades to mudlib releases.

Misunderstood tags are writen to the log file specified as LOG_AUTODOC.
