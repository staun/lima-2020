===>  CODE DONATIONS
We accept code donations :-).  Several people have
contributed code so far that will be incorporated into
the next release of the lib.  If you have something that
you feel would make sense in the general release, or that
you feel some other people might be interested in using:

(1) ftp it to lima.mudlib.org:/muds/bean
(2) on Lima Bean, it should appear in the /ftp directory.  Move
    it to a directory called /open/yourname, creating that directory
    if necessary
(3) post a news message to lima.contrib, with a summary of what it
    does, where it can be found, etc

Any code donated will become "owned" by the Lima team,
insofar as you relenquish a say in its usage, distribution,
derived works, etc.

Your code WILL remain attributed to you, though.  We will
not "steal" the code.
