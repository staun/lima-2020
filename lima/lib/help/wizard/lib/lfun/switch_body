NAME
	switch_body   (lfun)
SYNOPSIS
	varargs void switch_body( mixed new_body );
This function is defined in login.c
this_object() must be equivolent to this_player()->query_link()
for this function to execute correctly, and the target body must 
have the functions init_user() and init_cmd_hook() before
a transfer is possible.
If an object is passed for new_body, an attempt will be made
to directly move the user into the object.  If a string
is passed, the attempt will be made on a clone of the object.
If no argument is passed, it will act as the 'su' command, and
give this_player() a new player object.
