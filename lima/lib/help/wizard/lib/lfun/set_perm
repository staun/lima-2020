NAME
	set_perm (lfun)
SYNOPSIS
	void set_perm( mixed key, mixed value );
Sets the key to value in a non-static mapping.
The difference between set and set_perm, as is true with related
functions is that in objects that save_object() such as
players, anything with a _perm will be a permanent change.
Notice that they are 2 seperate functios, with 2 seperate
databases.
