	query__perm (lfun)
SYNOPSIS
	mixed query_perm( mixed key );
Returns the value of the passed key in the mapping gained by
iheriting object.c
The difference between this and query_perm, as with related
functions is that in objects that save_object() such as
players, anything with a _perm will be a permanent change.
Notice that they are 2 seperate functios, with 2 seperate
databases.
