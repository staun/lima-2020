The /std/reporter inheritable implements an easy way to gather
bug reports/ideas/any small piece of text from users.

void begin_report(string log_file, string type)
    type gives the type of report.  The entry will look like:

    <type>: <who> reports from <where> on <date and time>
    <text entered by player>
    *******************************************************

    log_file is the file to which the text is appended.  When
    this routine is called, the player is put into the editor.
    After he finishes typing, the text is appended to the
    log file.

void short_report(string log_file, string type, string text)
    just like the routine above, but use 'text' instead of putting
    the player into the editor.
