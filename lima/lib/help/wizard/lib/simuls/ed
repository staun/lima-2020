NAME
	ed - masks the ed efun
SYNOPSIS:
	varargs void ed( string filename, closure to_call )

This override of the ed() efun (qv) expands on the 
functionality of the efun.  This version ensures that 2 people
are not editing the same file before allowing one to edit,
and allows one to pass a closure to be called when the ed
session is done.
