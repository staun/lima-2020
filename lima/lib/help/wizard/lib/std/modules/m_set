M_SET


 For keeping track of sets of numbers.  See also the set_bit()/test_bit()
 series of efuns.  The major advantage of this package is that the
 storage requirements are much lower for sets with many consecutive
 numbers, or for numbers which are sparsely distributed over a large
 range.  It isn't particularly efficient speedwise, but it is compact.

 The format is: x-x,y-z ...

Important Functions: 
 
     set_add(string set, int number) 
     set_remove(string set, int number)
     set_member(string set, int number)
