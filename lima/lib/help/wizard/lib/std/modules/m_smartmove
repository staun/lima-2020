M_SMARTMOVE


M_SMARTMOVE is a module that provides "smarter" movement for objects, from room to room.

Important Functions:

    move_to()     --   Moves the object to a new location.  Returns 1 if the move was successful, 
                       0 if not.  The first arg is a filename, second is direction that caused
                       the movement.

    move_me_there() -- This is the heart of this module.  This is where the actual moving of the
                       object takes place.
