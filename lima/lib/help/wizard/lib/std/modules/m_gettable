M_GETTABLE


The gettable module is what you need to inherit
if you want your players to be able to get your
object.  

Functions that you call from your create():

  set_getmsg() - This functions allows you to define a personal/unique
                 get message for your object.  The mudib will display 
                 this message when a player gets your object.

  set_gettable() -  This function tells the mud whether or not your
                    object is gettable.  A 1 and the object is 
                    gettable, a 0 and it is not.

  set_dropmsg() -  This function allows you to define a personal/unique
                   message for when a player drops your object.

  set_dropable() - This function allows you to tell the mud if this 
                   object is droppable.  A 1 means yes this object
                   can be dropped, a 0 means that it can not be dropped.
      
Functions that you can overload:

  get() -  This function is defined for you in m_gettable.c
           however if you wanted to have something very unique
           happen when someone gets your object, you can overload 
           this function in your object.  Note that you are then
           responsible for the correct behavior of get.

  drop() -  same as above, only with drop.

  prevent_get()  - This function is a hook into your object.  Gives 
                   your object and extract chance to not be picked up  
                   the default will be whatever you put in set_gettable
                   however you can overload this function to do 
                   somethign unique.          

Other important functions:

  query_dropmsg() -  This function returns the response that you
                            set in set_dropmsg().

  query_getmsg() - same as above but get instead.
