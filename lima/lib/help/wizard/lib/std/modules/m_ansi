M_ANSI

The Lima approach to ansi color is a bit differant than 
most mudlibs.  We don't pass every string through the ansi 
module.  We only pass strings through that may have ansi 
associated with them.  Thus saving the CPU time that is
wasted on strings that will never have ansi codes in them.

What you need to do is inherit M_ANSI take whatever string 
that will have the ansi codes in it and pass it to the ansi()
function in the module.

Important Functions:

    ansi()      - This function gets passed to it the strings
                  containing the standard %^ ansi codes, and
                  returns the strings to the users in color
                  if he has ansi set, and without the %^ codes
                  if he does not.

    i_use_ansi()-  Checks to see if the player has ansi set on.
           
    create()    -  Does the initial creation of the color codes, etc.
