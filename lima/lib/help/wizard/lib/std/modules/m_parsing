M_PARSING

M_PARSING helps interact with the parser.

Important Functions:

    condense_phrase(arr) -- condenses a 3 element array of parser output:
                            ({object, prep, object}) into a single object or group of objects.
                            Essentially reduces prepositional phrases, but not super-studly-smart.

    nonsense()           -- Sets the message the user is going to see on failure of
                            his action to something random along the lines of:  "What a concept!"

    useless(action)      -- Returns a string that randomly adds to the string
                            action something along the lines of: " is a waste of time".  Eg,
                            useless("beating the drum")  might return "beating the drum isn't
                            notably helpful."
