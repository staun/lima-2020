M_DIGGER

M_DIGGER is used to make an object able to be used for digging.
This module also requires the use of M_INPUT.

Functions you call in your setup():

Important functions:
  
   answer_question(input)  --  Allows the player the change to repond to the question
                               what do you want to dig in?

   do_digging(object)      --  This is where the digging happens.  If you have supply no 
                               object to dig in, answer_question() is called.  If the
                               object you want to dig in can't be dug in it will respond
                               "There is nothing in which to dig here.".

                               If the object is ok to dig in, dig() will be called in that 
                               object.

Other functions:

    can_dig()
    can_dig_with_obj()
    direct_dig_with_obj()
    indirect_dig_obj_with_obj()
    indirect_dig_in_obj_with_obj()
    indirect_dig_up_obj_with_obj() 
    indirect_dig_out_obj_with_obj()
    direct_dig_with_obj_in_obj()

The above functions are parser callbacks.  By default all these return 1, 
meaning that that action can happen.  If you wish to change that defualt
behavior you may overload these in your object.
