M_CLIMBABLE

This module adds the functionality of climbing to your object.
By inheriting this module your object becomes climbable.

Functions to place in your setup():

     set_up_destination(string)  -  This supplies the path to the room
                                    your object leads to.  It is used 
                                    if the player types climb up foo,
                                    or climb foo if there is no down 
                                    destination.

     set_down_destination(string) -  This supplies the path to the room 
                                     your object leads to.  It is used
                                     if the player types climb down foo 
                                     or climb foo and there is no up
                                     destination.

Important Functions:
  
     The following three functions are callbacks for the parser.
     You can overload these in your object if you have any special
     circumstances.

     direct_climb_up_obj()   --  By default this checks to see if there is 
                                 an up destination set.  If not it fails.
     
     direct_climb_down_obj() -   By default this checks to see if there is 
                                 a down destination set.  If not it fails.
     
     direct_climb_obj()      -   By default checks to see if there is an up
                                 or a down destination.
