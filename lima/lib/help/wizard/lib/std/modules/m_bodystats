M_BODYSTATS

This module provides the game body with stats.
Everything that follows and has a ** next to it was taken directly from the module.

** This module should be inherited into anything requiring physical
** statistics/characteristics.  Typically, this will be used by a
** player's body, or an NPC.
**
** Stat values have the range: [0,100].  Typical values:
**
**	10	Joe Human
**	20	Newbie Hero (average value at character creation time)
**	50	Mid-level experience
**	80	Master/high-level
**	90	History will remember you
**	95	Frightening
**	100	Pure god-like status
**
** Statistics have a number of basic values which are "rolled" at
** character creation time.  These differentiate starting characters
** from one another.
**
**	Strength:	physical stature, power, brute force
**		Weakling vs. strong/powerful
**
**	Agility:	body control, speed, flexibility
**		Uncoordinated vs. excellent control
**
**	Intelligence:	inherent capability for learning
**		Dumb vs. smart/capable
**
**	Willpower:	drive, stamina
**		Unmotivated vs. driven/fanatical
**
** A good number of statistics are derived from the base statistics.
**
**	Constitution:	physical/mental stamina, sturdiness
**		Elf vs. dwarf
**
**	Wisdom:		collected knowledge
**		Naive vs. wise
**
**	Charisma:	natural attraction, leadership, persuasion
**		Nobody vs. great leader/speaker
**
** 950813, Deathblade: created.
