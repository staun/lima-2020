M_OPENABLE

M_OPENABLE is used to give your object basic opening and closing capabilities.

Functions you call from your setup():

    set_closed()   -- This function is where you tell the mudlib whether your object
                      is open or closed.  This function also does a few more subtle 
                      things, first is to change the adjective (open, closed) on the door.
                      Second, is to check the visibility of the players inventory, as that
                      may have changed.

    
   set_open_desc() -- This function is the in room description for your object when it is
                      open.  

   set_closed_desc() -- This function is the in room description for your object when it is 
                        closed.


   set_open_msg()  --  This function is the message players will see when they open your object.

   set_close_msg() -- This function is the message players will see when they close your object.

Important Functions:

   openable()      --  Returns 1.  

   query_closed()  --  Returns 1 if the door is closed, or 0 if its open.

   query_closed_desc()  --  Returns the closed description of the object.

   query_open_desc()    --  Returns the open message fo the object.

   open_with()     --  Is called from the verb handler for open.  This function handles all the
                       opening functionality for the object.  It also calls 2 hooks, 
                       the first one is "prevent_open", the second is "open".

   close()         --  Is called from the verb handler for close.  This function handles all the 
                       closing functionality for the object.  It also calls 2 hooks, 
                       the first is "prevent_close", and the second is "close",

   is_open()       --  returns 1 is the object is open, 0 if it is closed.

Other Functions:

   direct_open_obj()  --  REturns 1 if the object is not already open.

   direct_close_obj() --  Returns 1 if the object is not already closed.

   internal_setup()   --  Is strictly called by the mudlib.

Hooks:

   "prevent_open"    --  This hook is called from open_with(), and it presents your object with
                         one last chance to stop itself from being opened.  In order to use this
                         in your objects setup() you need to place the following

                              add_hook("prevent_open", (: my_open_func :) );

                         when someone tries to open your object, and the process reaches the 
                         open_with(), this function will be called, return 1 for success, 0
                         if it fails.

   "prevent_close"   --  This hook is called from close(), and it presents your object with
                         one last chance to stop itself from being closed.  In order to use this
                         in your objects setup() you need to place the following

                              add_hook("prevent_close", (: my_close_func :) );

                         when someone tries to close your object, and the process reaches the 
                         close(), this function will be called, return 1 for success, 0
                         if it fails.

   "open","close"    --  These hooks get called when someone managed to successfully close 
                         or open your object.  This gives the object a chance for a unique 
                         action or to do some other things.
