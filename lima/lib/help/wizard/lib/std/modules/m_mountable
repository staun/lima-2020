M_MOUNTABLE

M_MOUNTABLE is used to have your object able to be mounted.  A good example
of this is a horse, or other vehicle that you would ride on.  By default
an object that is mountable can not be entered.

Functions to call from your setup():

     set_get_on_msg(msg) --  This allows you to set a unique message for getting
                             on your object.  This message follows the pattern
                             of the other message $N $vget on $o.

     set_get_off_msg(msg) -- This allows you to set a unique message for getting
                             off of your object.  This message follows the pattern
                             of the other message $N $vget off of $o.

Important Functions:

     query_get_off_msg()  -- This function returns the message from set_get_off_msg().

     query_get_on_msg()   -- This functions returns the message from set_get_on_msg().

     handle_exit_msgs()   -- this returns the get_off_msg(), or the default of 
                                &N $vget off .

     mount_it_already()   -- This function handles the actual moving of the player to 
                             your object.  If you are already on the object it returns 
                             an appropriate message.


Other Functions:
           
    direct_sit_on_obj()   -- By default returns 1.  This may be overloaded in your object.

    sit()                 -- This gets called by the verb handler, and it then calls 
                             mount_it_already().
   
    stand()               -- Returns the ..get_off_msg(), or the default of $N $vget off .

    direct_mount_obj()    -- By default returns 1.  

    mount()               -- This gets called by the verb handler for mount, and it then 
                             calls mount_it_already().

    get_on()              -- This gets called by the verb handler fot get, and it then calls
                             mount_it_already().

    direct_dismount()     -- By default reuturns 1.  
            
    dismount()            -- This gets called by the verb handler for dismount.  If you are not
                             on this object return the apropriate message.  otherwise call stand().

    direct_enter_obj()    -- This gets called by the verb handler for enter.  It makes no sense to 
                             enter mos objects that you would mount, so we return 0 here.  Remember 
                             that if it makes sense to be able to enter this, overload it.          

    direct_get_on()       -- Returns 1.

    direct_get_off()      -- Returns 1.
