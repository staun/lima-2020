ACTIONS


Last Updated: Monday, April 15, 1996

How do I get my monster to use LIMA's 
really cool emotes, and emotes that I 
make up.

The answer is by inheriting M_ACTIONS.
This allows you to have your monster 
spout off emotes to players, etc.  

To use this option, in your monsters
setup(), place the followinf function:

   set_actions(chance, action)

The action will happen try and happen every
5 seconds,  At that time the monster will
have a 1 in 'chance' probability of doing
the action.

Action can be a single action or an array
of actions.  In the case for multiple 
actions, one is choosen at random if the
action occurs. 

The following is an example monster's setup()
that is using using set_actions().


void setup()
{
    set_name("Harry");
    set_gender(1);
    set_proper_name("Harry the affectionate");
    set_in_room_desc("Harry the affectionate");
    add_id("dude");
    set_long("Harry has an agreeable look.");
    set_actions( 10, ({
	"say What are you waiting for?",
	    "say Hello there!",
	    "say I don't like winter.",
	    "say I don't like snow.",
	    "say I don't like rain.",
	    "say Who are you?",
	    "say Why do you look like that?",
	    "say What are you doing here?",
	    "say Nice weather, isn't it?",
	    "smile",
	    "lsfbog",
	    "ack",
//      "chan gossip Is this thing on?",
	    "rock"
	    }) );
***  I clipped some this out as it wasnt 
     relevant to this example.
}

The important thing to notice out of this
example is the set_actions().  This one 
says that every 5 seconds, Harry has a 
1 in 10 chance of doing one of the array
of actions.  Also notice notice that it is
possible to have Harry do an action over
a public channel, even though it is 
commented out on Lima Bean.

Scripts

You can also have your monster follow a 
"script", this is currently bugged and 
the documentaion will follow later.
