M_KNOCKABLE

M_KNOCKABLE is a very simple module to allow someone to knock on a door.
The action of knock on door, produces mothing more than a message saying
that the player knocked on the door.  This function is inherited by DOOR.

At some point there may be an action on the "other side" of the door, so 
that if you are in the room you would "hear" somebody knock.

Important Functions:

     direct_knock_on_obj()   --  Verb callbacks that return 1 by default
     direct_knock_at_obj()       you may overload these if you need to.

     knock_knock()           --  This is the function called by the knock verb if all
                                 the callbacks return 1.  All it does at the moment
                                 is print a message saying the player knocked on the
                                 door.
