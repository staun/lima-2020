M_DAMAGE_SINK


M_DAMAGE_SINK is inherited into /std/armor already.  This is 
where the amount of damage that a piece of armor prevents is 
handled at.

Functions to call from your setup():

     set_armor_class(int)  --  Set the protection of a particular
                               piece of armor.  This function takes
                               an integer for an argument.  The higher
                               the integer the "better" the armor.

     set_resist(type, amount)  --  Specifies that for damage of 
                               type 'type', armor class should be
                               increased by amount.

Other Functions:

     query_armor_class() --    This function returns the armor class
                               of a particular piece of armor.  This is
                               the raw armor class not modified for any 
                               type of resistance.

     is_armor()  --            Will return 1 if the object is a type of armor.
