M_SAVE

M_SAVE implements persistence in the mudlib. Persistence being the ability to
to save items over a reboot.  i.e. inventory, lockers etc.   

Functions you call in your setup():

    add_save()    --   This function is how you tag certain variables to be saved as well.
                       In other words if you have an object the degrades over time, you would
                       call add_save() with teh variables as parameters so that the lib knows 
                       what to save.

Important Functions():

    
    get_saved()   --  Returns the variables to be saved.

    save_to_string()  --  This function saves the object and its inventory into a string
                          representation.  Pass this function an integer of 1 if you want the
                          save to be recursive.

    load_from_string() --  Takes the given string and restores the object to the exact object
                           it was before save_to_string() was called on it.
