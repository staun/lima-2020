M_EBTERABLE


M_ENTERABLE allows you to make your object enterable.  You can
also set unique enter/exit messages.  You should also see the
help in the modules section for messages.

Functions that you call from your setup():

     set_on_enter_msg(msg) --  Allows you to set a unique message
                               that the players in the room will
                               see as well as the person entering 
                               the object.  This message is passed
                               through the parser, and is in the 
                               format "$N $vooze coolness as $p $venter the camaro.".

     set_on_exit_msg(msg)  --  Allows you to set a unique message that 
                               the players in the room will see as well
                               as the person entering the object. This
                               message is passed through the parser, and
                               follows the format of "$N $vooze...".

Important Functions:

     direct_enter_obj()        This group of functions are callbacks from 
     direct_get_in_obj()   --  the parser, and tell the parser if its ok    
     direct_exit_obj()         to enter/exit/get in the object in question.

     get_in_obj()          --  Handles the command get in object, this 
                               function actually calls do_enter().
     
     do_enter()            --  Checks to see if you are already in the object, 
                               if so it tells you that, if not the appropriate
                               calls are made to move the player into the object.


All of the functions in the Important Functions section may be overloaded to 
modify the default behavior.
