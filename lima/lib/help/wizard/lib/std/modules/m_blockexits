How do I make my monster block certain exits.

Inherit M_BLOCKEXITS in your monster.  This 
will allow you to block, unblock and 
customize the actions your monster takes.

The functions that need to be placed in your 
setup(), inorder to make your monster block
exits are the following:

   add_block(direction)
   set_block_action()

add_block() is used to tell the lib what exits 
to block.  It takes an array of directions as in 
add_block( ({ "east","west" }) ).  You can also
enter "all" to block all exits out of the room.

set_block_action() can take many differant types of 
arguments depending on what you would like to 
do.

     set_block_action("$N $vblock the exit");

If the argument to set_block_action is a string, 
that is treated as a targetted action, and will
display the appropriate messages to the 
appropriate objects.  

     set_block_action("#string");

If the argument is a string prepended by a #, only 
the user will see that message.

     set_block_action( (: special_action :) )

If the arguemnt is a function, the appropriate 
function will be called, in this case special_action()
and the direction and person will be passed as
arguments to it.  If this function returns anything
besides 1, the move will fail (be blocked).


     remove_block()

This function will remove a block from an exit, or 
an array of exits. Remove_block(({"west, "east"}))
