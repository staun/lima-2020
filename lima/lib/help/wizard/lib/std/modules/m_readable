M_READABLE

M_READABLE is used to make your object readable. i.e. a book, a sign etc.

Functions to call from your setup():

    set_text( text ) -- This is where you set the text that you wish to have the player read.
                        
    set_entries( mapping entries) --  This is where you can set that your "book" has multiple
                                      pages or entries etc.  "foo" : "The catch all phrase
                                      people use to describe something."   


Important Functions:

    read()         --   This function is called by the verb handler, and only used if there is only
                        one entry, i.e. set_text was used.

    read_entry()   --   Is used to read a particular entry from the list specified in the 
                        set_entries() function.

Other Fuctions:

    has_entries()  --   Returns whether or not the object has entries.

    direct_read_obj() --  This function checks to see if   there is readable text (set_text()),
                          if there is, return 1, other wise if no entries, or entries return an
                          appropriate message.

    direct_read_str_word_obj()  --  This function checks to see if there are entries, if not 
                                    return an error message.
