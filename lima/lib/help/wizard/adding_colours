If CONFIGURABLE_COLOURS is defined in config.h, Lima lets users decide what
colours, if any, they want certain pieces of text to have.

From the player's standpoint: 

The 'colours' command lists their current colour settings.  These
can be changed by doing 'colours <which setting> <whatever>'.

From the coder's standpoint:

If you want a piece of text to be work with this system, the following
is necessary.  First, make up a name for the setting, like
"combat_messages".  Then, use %%^^COMBAT_MESSAGES%%^^ just like
you would use any other colour code, remembering to turn it
off at the end with %%^^RESET%%^^.  For example,

tell(this_body(), "%%^^COMBAT_MESSAGES%%^^" + message + "%%^^RESET%%^^");

[Note that RESET isn't strictly necessary here, since tell()
 automatically puts one at the end]

Then, if this is a NEW type, you must add it with admtool.  Under admtool,
select 'd' for daemons, then 'C' for colour, then 'a COMBAT_MESSAGES none',
where 'none' can be any legal colour setting and is the default value.

That's it!  The colour should automatically start working as soon as it is
added by admtool.
