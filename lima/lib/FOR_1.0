1.0 will be released when we arbitrarily declare that there are no
known bugs (arbitrary meaning we reserve the right to label a bug
we're never going to fix a feature ;-)

Misc things that should be done soon or the idea discarded:
- skill examples (and integration w/ lib): combat, spells, misc
- spell examples: objects, training, books, interaction w/ skills, admin'ing
- guild examples: training, halls, guards, admin'ing
- admtool: wizdir administration
- msg/review
- fix location of mail messages
- ambiguity on drop, throw, etc...
- modularize stats, skills, and races fully
- newsreader changes, mailer changes
- more ANSI usage
- more LPScript support
- more documentation of code
- Adversary documentation (nudge Iizuka)
- Use of SQL interfaces in the driver to replace some .o's (like news)
- New web pages to replace the ones lost in the crash

Features unrelated to gaming, to be included post-alpha 
(even though alpha means feature freeze):
- I3: OOB services, better channels
- time zone support
- possibly water/underwater rooms

Future versions (Post 1.0):
- mail unsend
- conversion of SECURE_D to array of paths, not a tree
- RCP
