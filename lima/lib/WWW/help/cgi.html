<title>Cgi scripts</title>
<h3>
Cgi scripts are very easy to code.  If you know LPC, and you know HTML, then
you know everything you will need to know.  
Cgi scripts are contained in the SECURE_CGI_DIR as defined by the 
<a href = /help/configure.html>config file</a>.  When 
a script is requested by someone over the web, the function main() is called
on the object.  The server expects main() to return a string, which is a
formatted web page.  This web page can be built on the fly, which is where 
you can have all your fun ;).
