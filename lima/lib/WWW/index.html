<center><h2>Welcome to the Lima http server</h2></center>
<h3>
The internal http server can be used for many things.  It's intended use
is to make your mud interact with the WWW.  This is done through
<a href = /help/cgi.html> cgi scripts</a> and through regular web pages.
The server allows you to support <a href = /help/homepage.html> home pages </a>
for your wizards.  Click <a href = /help/configure.html>here</a> for help 
configuring your http server.


In addition, a few examples come with the Lima mudlib:

<ul>
<li> <a href = "scgi/webed.c"> LPC Editor</a>
<li> <a href = "fingeruser.html"> An interface to the 'finger' command</a>
