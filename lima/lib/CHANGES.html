<p><h1>Changes since Lima 1.0b1</h1></p>
<DL>
<DT><em>Sun Jul  2 09:00:32 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> updated help release<p>
<DT><em>Sun Jul  2 22:08:05 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> modified compile() in LPSCRIPT_D so that it will not regenerate the tmp file if the tmp file is newer than the source file.<p>
<DT><em>Fri Jul  7 14:45:01 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> made a change to SOCKET to utilize an updated socket_address() efun<p>
<DT><em>Fri Jul  7 16:38:34 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> added a local_address() function to SOCKET (That's harder to get than you might think and this way is better)<p>
<DT><em>Fri Jul  7 16:38:34 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> made various modifications to FTP_D to remove resolve() calls that are no longer necessary with the recent SOCKET modifications<p>
<DT><em>Sat Jul  8 00:43:46 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> fixed FTP_D to return an empty list when trying to ls <filename>/. rather than a 550 error.  The other way worked, but was not what is proper. (This still isn't perfect, but it's much much closer.  It's not an error now, but still gives an extra linefeed, which may be acceptable)<p>
<DT><em>Fri Jul 14 12:58:51 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed BODY (/std/body.c) to inherit /std/body/skills.c (subject to the define USE_SKILLS), removing comments and fixing a typo.<p>
<DT><em>Sat Jul 15 12:18:58 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed M_ITEMS (/std/modules/m_items.c), changing "long" to "look" in line 43.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jul 18 09:49:03 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> fixed a typo in M_EXIT on line 327.  query_method_destination should be query_method_description<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jul 18 10:14:55 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> made a modification to M_EXIT to automatically append a \n to an exit description if it does not already have one.  (lines 341,342 added)<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jul 18 10:24:53 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> modified the look verb so that you can now look at exits.  This means that exits can be described with set_exit_description(dir,desc) from the room.  (This function is smart enough to set the long of complex exits as well though not preferred and may change).  add_item()'s will still error if you add_item() an item with the same name as a simple exit(which shouldn't happen).<p>
<DT><em>Sun Jul 23 09:53:34 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed the typo "bask" to "back" in /domains/std/Example_Room1.c<p>
<DT><em>Sun Jul 23 12:04:27 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> extended /include/combat_modules.h to handle FORMULA_STATS.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Jul 23 12:09:05 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> extended /std/adversary/mod_config.c to recognise FORMULA_STATS as a valid option.<p>
<DT><em>Wed Aug  2 14:16:01 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> (re)installed the colours command that works without the CONFIGURABLE_COLOUR define that was removed a /long/ time ago<p>
<DT><em>Sun Aug  6 08:29:16 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed /domains/std/table.c, changing the inherit from COMPLEX_CONTAINER to CONTAINER and added a default relation of "on" (Thanks to Jonez for pointing this out).<p>
<DT><em>Sun Aug  6 12:34:30 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended PLAYER_MENU (/obj/mudlib/plmemu.c) to better handle prompting to change the ansi setting, by adding an intermediate function prompt_change_ansi() (problem and solution courtesy of Jonez).<p>
<DT><em>Sun Aug  6 13:39:12 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> added some additional LPSCRIPT functionality to OBJECT>  Objects now retain their lpscript_attributes after first use so that they do not have to be recalculated every time an lpscript object is loaded.  A list of lpscript_attributes for a given object can also be acquired with list_lpscript_attributes().  A copy of the mapping is attained through dump_lpscript_attributes().<p>
<DT><em>Tue Aug  8 20:09:08 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> changed the north exit in /domains/std/cult/Foyer.c from ../room2 to ../Relations_And_Toys. Thanks to Marroc for pointing this out.<p>

<DT><em>Mon Sep  4 21:32:48 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> added go down as an equivalent to descend and 'go up' as an equivalent to 'ascend' in METHOD_D<p>
<DT><em>Thu Sep  7 09:08:20 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> added has_method() to M_COMPLEX_EXIT<p>
<DT><em>Thu Sep  7 09:09:10 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> rewrote STAIRS.  This may be a bit of a compat buster, but I don't think so.  It is no longer necessary for STAIRS to have arguments passed to it's crete/setup() in order for them to properly function.<p>
<DT><em>Thu Sep  7 09:09:50 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> fixed /std/object/names.c so that add_adjective will set a primary_adjective if one does not already exisdt.<p>
<DT><em>Thu Sep  7 11:08:32 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> added the verbs ascend and descend<p>
<DT><em>Thu Sep  7 19:28:41 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>

<DD> improved /obj/admtool/daemons/body.c, fixing the description of the 'r' option (remove limb) to distinguish it from 'R' (remove body), and added attacking to the valid limb types referred to in line 93 in set_limb_flags().<p>
<DT><em>Tue Sep 12 19:27:25 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> added a check for valid body type into add_limb_to_body() in BODY_D (/daemons/body_d.c).<p>

<DD> amended "/bulders/" to "/wiz/" in DOC_D (/daemons/doc_d.c). Thanks to Marroc for spotting it.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Sep 17 01:02:37 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> improved the messaging in do_diagnose_liv() in /cmds/verbs/diagnose.c, to avoid others in the room seeing full details - problem reported by Krant.<p>

<DT><em>Fri Sep 29 11:08:40 2000</em>: <strong>Iizuka</strong>
<DD> installed /std/accountant.c.  This solves the LPscript problem reported by Marroc.  This assumes adversary, so if you want one from living either modify this or make a similar object using living instead.<p>

<DD> fixed follow_hook() in M_FOLLOW (/std/modules/m_follow.c) to improve following, including support for function pointers and better checking.<p>

<DD> added a comment to imud_d.c about us-1.i3.intermud.org being the router address. would be nice if somebody could change imud_d.c to use a hostname rather than a bare IP<p>
<DT><em>Fri Oct 13 21:40:59 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>

<DD> amended query_mail_forward() in NEWS_D (/daemons/news_d.c) as suggested by Marroc, to return an array, empty if no mail forward, and 0 for permission denied.<p>
<DT><em>Thu Mar  1 09:47:31 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended /obj/admtool/daemons/news.c to reflect the amendment above.<p>
<DT><em>Thu Mar  1 09:48:55 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended show_exits() in M_EXIT (/std/modules/m_exit.c), installing Marroc's fix to better handle case with all exits hidden.<p>
<DT><em>Thu Mar  1 09:57:23 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> added Marroc's proposed fix to /std/body/quests.c, returning 0 for check_quest() if there are no quests.<p>
<DT><em>Fri Mar  2 08:22:25 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> added error-checking into can_drive_str() in /cmds/verbs/drive.c so that attempting to drive whilst not in a vehicle is better handled.<p>
<DT><em>Sat Mar  3 08:12:44 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended CORPSE (/std/corpse.c) to remove the $v from $vgnaw in the set_decay_action() in mudlib_setup().<p>
<DT><em>Mon Mar  5 08:31:06 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended direct_enter_obj() in /domains/std/objects/sand_castle.c to return a suitable failure message (moving the one from do_enter()).<p>
<DT><em>Tue Mar  6 19:01:26 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed /domains/std/object/dock_wall.c to use do_close instead of close in its trigger() function.<p>
<DT><em>Wed Mar  7 17:50:46 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> removed /daemons/cmd.c (unneeded - misplaced copy of /daemons/channel/cmd.c).<p>
<DT><em>Sat Mar 10 10:28:46 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended rcv_finger_reply() in /daemons/imud/finger.c to convert int to string for those muds which choose to break the I3 protocol by returning level as int instead of string.<p>
<DT><em>Fri Mar 23 05:29:59 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed check_previous() in GUILD_D (/daemons/guild_d.c) to take the argument passed - thanks to Sarak for pointing it out.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Mar 25 14:58:49 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> added Marroc's proposed changes to /secure/master.c, to better handle errors of the 'which ... do you mean?' type, adding parser_gen_pos() and amending the ERR_AMBIG case in parser_error_message() to use it.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Mar 27 08:05:31 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> installed Marroc's recursive extension to his fix to the master for ambiguous errors - see parser_gen_pos() and parser_error_message().<p>
<DT><em>Thu Mar 29 15:03:02 2001</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> fixed it so that remote tells from others show up in your tell history.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Apr 10 02:53:36 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> created newsgroup lima.bugs.fixed, for bugreps that are supposedly fixed, so that they do not clutter the lima.bugs group.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Apr 10 15:27:25 2001</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> made it so that when I3 reports an error it tells you the mud name that sent the error.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Apr 16 19:39:35 2001</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> tweaked HTTP_D so that it parses cgi a bit better with arguments (? vs ?=)<p>
<DT><em>Tue Apr 17 05:51:51 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended make_unique_objects_if_needed() in CONTAINER (/std/container.c), adding a clonep() filter and adjusting the number by 1, which should ensure correct number of unique clones created on initial cloning.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Apr 17 05:55:01 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed the default fill_action in M_FLUID_SOURCE (/std/modules/m_fluid_source.c), changing withdraw to $vwithdraw.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Apr 17 05:58:49 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended M_READABLE (/std/modules/m_readable.c), adding set_entry_synonyms() as an alternative to set_synonyms() and adjusting the autodoc help appropriately.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Apr 17 06:07:43 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> made fixes to M_FOLLOW (/std/modules/m_follow.c), changing autodoc name of set_follow_search() from set_follow_string, adding a did_move() into do_follow_obj() and improving arrive_hook().<p>
<DT><em>Mon Apr 23 02:54:55 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> amended /cmds/player/colours.c, removing the check for CONFIGURABLE_COLOUR (this was probably fixed before, but lost).<p>
<DT><em>Mon Apr 23 02:58:35 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> added support for colours in admtool using the defined colours ADMTOOL_HEADING, ADMTOOL_HI and ADMTOOL_LO. Modified /obj/admtool/admtool2.c, /obj/admtool/internal/base.c slightly. The colours default to 'none'.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Apr 24 00:38:03 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> amended ADVERSARY (/std/adversary.c), ARMOR (/std/armor.c), CONTAINER (/std/container.c), FLAME (/std/flame.c), FOLLOWING_MONSTER (/std/following_monster.c), FOOD (/std/food.c), KEY (/std/key.c), PAPER (/std/paper.c), SIGN (/std/sign.c), TORCH (/std/torch.c), WANDERING_MONSTER (/std/wandering_monster.c) and WEAPON (/std/weapon.c) -- Eliminating calls to ::lpscript_attributes() in inherited modules etc, as they are redundant; LPSCRIPT_D digs through all the inherits by itself.<p>
<DT><em>Thu May 10 14:19:49 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> updated M_SIBLING (/std/modules/m_sibling.c) to use a function instead of a string to refer to the sibling room path, removing the need for initialisation through on_clone().<p>
<DT><em>Thu May 10 14:20:07 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> updated DOOR (/std/door.c) to reflect the changes in M_SIBLING.<p>
<DT><em>Fri May 11 04:03:02 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> added a 'destruct(ob)' into add_sell() in M_VENDOR (/std/modules/m_vendor.c) to remove items which are cloned as part of the sales process but neither used nor removed properly.<p>
<DT><em>Fri May 11 05:56:38 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> added the concept of a 'through' object in the movement system, that specifies the object through which you enter a room. This enables enter/leave msgs to make more sense, especially when one room has a "northern door" that you walk through, entering the next room through it's "southern door". Complex exit objects automatically set the 'through' object if they can find a sibling at the destination. Modified CLASS_MOVE (/std/classes/move.c), M_COMPLEX_EXIT (/std/modules/m_complex_exit.c) and M_SMARTMOVE (/std/modules/m_smartmove.c).<p>
<DT><em>Fri May 11 06:09:32 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> updated SECRET_DOOR (/std/secret_door.c), replacing call to get_default_exit() with query_default_error() so that it'll return the proper error message if trying to walk through the door without opening it (same message as if trying to walk in an invalid direction).<p>
<DT><em>Fri May 11 06:11:08 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> modified M_OPENABLE (/std/modules/m_openable.c), commenting out the code that changes adjectives of the object depending on open/closed state, as the new adjective seems to become primary, interfering with what you set in the object.<p>
<DT><em>Fri May 11 07:52:59 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> added punctiation and a newline to the return message of door_check() in DOOR (/std/door.c)<p>
<DT><em>Fri May 11 08:12:09 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> modified /std/object/names.c, moving initialisation of primary_adj to resync(), where init. of primary_id is. Also modified set_id() and set_adj() to ensure the new ids/adjs end up in the beginning of the id/adj arrays, so that primary_id/adj resync properly.<p>
<DT><em>Sun May 13 16:19:06 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> amended M_COMPLEX_EXIT (/std/modules/m_complex_exit.c), removing call to error() in complex_exit_direct_verb_rule() when rule format is unexpected. It now returns 0 now, as would seem more proper when the check cannot handle the rule.<p>
<DT><em>Sun May 13 16:47:50 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed part of the 'Pirate Quest', changing "player_left" to "person_left" in on_clone() in /domains/std/objects/ocean.c, and changing the matching in award_points() to if(evaluate(direction) == "the ocean") in the same file, and set the granting object to ocean instead of room.<p>
</DL>
<p><h1>Changes since Lima 1.0b3</h1></p>
<DL>
<DT><em>Wed May 30 12:59:16 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> added a lima_version() sefun to /secure/simul_efun/misc.c, returning a version string like "Lima 1.0b3".<p>
<DT><em>Thu May 31 08:22:29 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended action_movement() in M_ACTIONS allow combination of wandering and set_actions to work better.<p>
<DT><em>Fri Jun  1 10:56:40 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed show_money() in M_ACCOUNTANT (/std/modules/accountant.c) which had lost the MONEY_D->currency_to_string() conversion (approx line 100). Thanks to Pteppic@Beyond the Flame for spotting it.<p>
<DT><em>Sat Jun  9 13:13:34 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> added a filter for userp() to listeners in rcv_channel_who_req() in /daemons/imud/channel.c, which was failing as it tried to use listeners->query_body()->query_name() with /daemons/chanlog_d.c included in listeners.<p>
<DT><em>Sat Jun  9 13:39:00 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended mudname to canon_mudname(mudname) in remote_listeners() in /daemons/imud_d/channel.c.<p>
<DT><em>Thu Jun 14 13:56:15 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed /domains/std/lima/workroom_ob.c, converting to use class for the argument in move_to() call. Thanks to Seven for reporting it.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Jun 17 13:29:52 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended /cmds/wiz/clean.c so it excludes add_items (simple_obs).<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jun 19 19:27:09 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> amended LPSCRIPT_D (/secure/daemons/lpscript_d.c), making handle_string() split long strings to multiple lines, thereby avoiding errors from the driver.<p>
<DT><em>Wed Jun 20 09:04:34 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> commented the set_enter_msg() line of /domains/std/Car_Wash.c as it was causing trouble. Needs more attention.<p>
<DT><em>Wed Jun 20 09:09:00 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> modified can_go_str() and do_go_str() of /cmds/verbs/go.c to enable moving around with vehicles.<p>
<DT><em>Wed Jun 20 09:12:10 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> switched departure and arrival msgs of /domains/std/camaro.c as they seemed to be in the wrong order, and generated errors.<p>
<DT><em>Wed Jun 20 10:10:54 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> modified complex_exit_do_verb_rule() of M_COMPLEX_EXIT (/std/modules/m_complex/exit.c) to allow for "WRD" rule, making "get out" etc possible.<p>
<DT><em>Wed Jun 20 10:11:26 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> added "get WRD" rule to /cmds/verbs/get.c, so that you can "get out" of vehicles.<p>
<DT><em>Wed Jun 20 11:42:40 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> updated M_SMARTMOVE (/std/modules/m_smartmove.c) to actually use data->who instead of this_body() for messaging; this_object() is also conceivable, but gives less options.<p>
<DT><em>Wed Jun 20 11:44:00 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> updated M_EXIT (/std/modules/m_exit.c) to correctly set exit->who both for moving with vehicle and without.<p>
<DT><em>Wed Jun 20 11:50:40 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> amended /domains/std/Example_Room1.c, changing can_go_east() to can_go_str(string dir) and checking that dir is "east".<p>
<DT><em>Wed Jun 27 03:38:28 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> added the if(!weapon) check back into chance_to_hit() in /std/adversary/formula/simple.c.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Jul  2 03:27:24 2001</em>: <strong>Smack</strong>
<DD> changed /std/body/title.c to use query_name() instead of query_userid() to better reflect chosen names.. could represent a security hole on muds that care<p>
<DT><em>Mon Jul  2 14:24:52 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended FTP_D (/secure/daemons/ftp_d.c) adding functions query_passives(), query_sessions() and query_dataports(), and amending FTP_CMD_pasv() to close previous passive pipe (if any) and amending FTP_CMD_quit() to close passive pipe (if any) and remove the entry from the passives mapping.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jul 17 07:54:43 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> amended can_go_str() in /domains/std/Example_Room1.c, having it call ::can_go_str() instead of just returning 1 so as to ensure proper checks are performed.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Jul 29 21:15:23 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended FTP_D (/secure/daemons/ftp_d.c) to restrict the range of ports used in passive mode - currently set to 4000 - 4100, but configurable as MIN_PORT and MAX_PORT.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Sep  3 22:50:07 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed chance_to_hit() in /std/adversary/formula/stats.c by changing the check from if(!weapon) to if(!weapon || weapon == this_object())<p>
<DT><em>Sun Sep 23 02:40:29 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> applied Kesac's proposed fixes to close a loophole which allows players to read unrestricted files into the editor (eg when mailing) by using "1r <filename>". Files amended : /trans/obj/ed_session.c and /trans/obj/edit_ob.c.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Nov 18 21:26:06 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended /include/config to define ANON_CAN_PUT, so non-wizards have limited ablility to upload - hence can put contributions into /open etc.<p>
<DT><em>Wed Dec 19 05:15:40 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended /include/driver/runtime.h, changing the define of BASE_CONFIG_INT from (BASE_CONFIG_STR + 14) to (BASE_CONFIG_STR + 15). Thanks to Dunedain for spotting it.<p>
<DT><em>Wed Dec 19 05:33:12 2001</em>: <strong>Dunedain</strong>
<DD> added a check in /cmds/player/random2.c to ensure that no mappings exceeded __MAX_MAPPING_SIZE__.  It should no longer error on first update.<p>
<DT><em>Fri Jan  4 22:46:31 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended inv_list() in /secure/simul_efun/objcalls.c to filter out null objects instead of erroring.<p>
<DT><em>Thu Feb 14 09:19:22 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended clean_up() in OBJ (/std/object.c) to use children() to check whether the file is inherited (and should not be cleaned up yet) instead of the 'instances' parameter passed, which appears to be inaccurate.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Feb 17 16:57:38 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended show_objects() in /std/rooms/roomdesc.c to correctly show players "(outside the...)" description in appropriate cases.<p>
<DT><em>Thu Feb 21 12:35:50 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> updated the greeter in /domains/std/ to reflect current info for where to get the lib (ie 'help release') and where to report MudOS bugs.<p>
<DT><em>Thu Feb 28 11:51:04 2002</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> fixed problem in parse_arg() of CMD_D (/secure/daemons/cmd_d.c) causing it not to parse OBFILE arguments correctly if they indirectly refer to LPSCRIPT objects (ie, "update here" would fail in an LPSCRIPT room). It seems that base_name() for an LPSCRIPT object returns the full filename, including ".scr".<p>
<DT><em>Thu Feb 28 12:02:27 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> added set_combat_message() to M_DAMAGE_SOURCE (/std/modules/m_damage_source.c) to allow the setting of a single combat message, replacing the existing one(s).<p>
<DT><em>Sun Mar  3 11:59:44 2002</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> added TaskTool, a useful tool for keeping track of development tasks etc, and allows you to mark them as completed. It's a tree structure, so you can add sub-tasks for every task, and completing a task is prohibited until all sub-tasks are completed. Installed TASK_D (/daemons/task_d.h), /obj/tasktool/* and /cmds/wiz/tasktool.c. Modified /include/daemons.h, /include/commands.h and /include/mudlib.h. Try it out :)<p>
<DT><em>Wed Mar  6 05:48:37 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed help on /secure/simul_efun/misc::is_normal_direction(), which had a typo in the FUNCTION token and for which the help comments appear to have been misposted from the call_trace function.<p>
<DT><em>Sat Mar 16 02:53:31 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed wrong tokens in the combat_sword dam3 message in MESSAGES_D (/daemons/messages_d.c).<p>

<DT><em>Mon Mar 18 15:35:15 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended /secure/user/login.c to use the lima_version() sefun in the message in login_handle_logon().<p>
<DT><em>Sun Apr  7 13:23:37 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended message for "stand" method in FURNITURE (/std/furniture.c) to $vstand (from $vstands). Thanks to Bunny for spotting it.<p>

<DT><em>Mon May  6 00:41:11 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended MORE_OB (/trans/obj/more_ob.c) to handle "large" files, by adding a "number of lines" parameter to read_file().<p>
<DT><em>Tue May  7 10:47:17 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> changed /std/adversary/armor/complex_slots.c, adding a reset_slots() function to set bodyslots to the default_slots mapping, simplifying the adding of new body slots to existing players.<p>
<DT><em>Fri May 17 11:59:22 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed /domains/std/Car_Wash.c so the set_enter_msg() is on the right exit (west), and the room now loads.<p>
<DT><em>Mon May 20 04:20:43 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> added some usage help to the colours command (/cmds/player/colours.c)<p>
<DT><em>Mon Jun  3 03:44:54 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended 'look' to use exit descriptions in M_EXIT for 'look <direction>'<p>
<DT><em>Wed Jun  5 14:12:18 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed query_exit_description() in M_EXIT (/std/modules/m_exit.c) to handle invalid directions without erroring.<p>
<DT><em>Sat Jun 15 11:21:53 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed main() in /WWW/cgi/who.c to strip the leading "=" to find individual players, instead of returning "No such player".<p>
<DT><em>Thu Jun 27 01:18:47 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended move() in /std/object/move.c to use default relation of dest where none is specified (otherwise give_new_obj() will break).<p>
<DT><em>Thu Jun 27 01:21:14 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> updated /domains/std/stone.c to the relation-based container system, adding the relation "in", making it the default relation, and adding it to set_hide_contents() in receive_object(). Additionally changed the condition in receive_object() to "if(target->id("sword"))".<p>
<DT><em>Sun Jun 30 14:08:19 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed the typo 'loccation' in /help/wizard/bin/start.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Aug 18 18:41:46 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> added a file size check to /trans/cmds/grep.c, similar to /trans/cmds/ed.c, and moved the actual value to /include/config.h - MAXFILESIZE, currently set to 1000000.<p>
<DT><em>Fri Aug 23 03:29:58 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> changed /obj/admtool/daemons/body.c::add_limb() to check sizeof(BODY_D->get_body()) instead of checking for 0.<p>
<DT><em>Sat Aug 24 17:01:26 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed problems in /domains/std/2.4.5/giant_conf.scr arising from non-existent attributes (armor_class and proper_name) and from the switching of weapon and sword.<p>
<DT><em>Sat Aug 24 20:43:36 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> added relations and default_relation to lpscript_attributes() in CONTAINER (/std/container.c).<p>
<DT><em>Sat Aug 24 20:51:30 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed /domains/std/2.4.5/sea_bottom, adding relations and default_relation to the octopus, and correcting the setting of objects in it, so it clones 1 chest containing random(500) gold, rather than random(500) chests (empty).<p>
<DT><em>Sat Aug 24 20:51:58 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed /domains/std/2.4.5/obj/chest, adding relations and default_relation and capacity.<p>
<DT><em>Sat Aug 24 22:07:29 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed /domains/std/2.4.5/forest2.scr, which used "money=500" instead of "objects=/std/money(1,500,"gold"), and also changed proper_name to primary_id.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Aug 25 00:13:33 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> changed this_body() to this_object() within the 'response' section of handle_block() in LPSCRIPT_D (/daemons/secure/lpscript_d.c), namely the part handling line[0] == "!" around line 500.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Aug 25 00:17:57 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> made various fixes to the beggar in /domains/std/2.4.5/yard, including inheriting M_ACTIONS by setting is=monster,actor, moving the "periodic" section from the room to the beggar, making those actions consistent (ie !says blah etc), and removing the query_money check in the trigger as it's no longer valid, and the money system doesn't easily support the intention of checking how much he has.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Aug 25 01:09:24 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> added a simple rope into /domains/std/2.4.5/big_tree - in place of the missing /domains/std/2.4.5/obj/rope (which would ideally handle tie and untie, if those verbs existed).<p>
<DT><em>Sun Aug 25 03:24:46 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> changed /domains/std/2.4.5/shop to use the standard M_VENDOR shop system, instead of the old (non-functional) add_actions, and also removed surplus related (non-functional) code from /domains/std/2.4.5/store and /domains/std/2.4.5/storage.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Aug 26 00:26:59 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> added support in LPSCRIPT_D (/secure/daemons/lpscript_d.c) for the following : "hidden_door", "key", "block" (M_BLOCKEXITS), "outdoor", "aggressive" (AGGRESSIVE_MONSTER), "wielded" and "worn".<p>
<DT><em>Mon Aug 26 00:27:24 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> added LPSCRIPT_WIELD and LPSCRIPT_WORN to /include/lpscript.h.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Aug 26 00:27:48 2002</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
