Sat Mar 22 10:12:16 2003: Tigran fixed a bug in /obj/admtool/daemons/i3chan.c that needed to wrap an int in a to_int() so that it was actually an int instead of a string in rcv_channel_add()

Sun Apr 27 11:15:52 2003: Loriel renamed inventory_header() to introduce_contents() in LIVING (/std/living.c) so inventory is now displayed as "X is carrying ..." instead of "X contains ...".

Mon Apr 28 22:31:06 2003: Loriel fixed M_DICE (/std/modules/m_dice.c) by adding missing "int" to the function declaration roll_dice(int num_dice, num_sides).

Fri May  2 08:07:27 2003: Loriel amended /cmds/verbs/drive.c and /cmds/verbs/go.c to use the sefun is_normal_direction() instead of using member_array() on an array of "normal directions".

Thu Jul  3 07:38:04 2003: Loriel added a can_get_wrd() function to the get verb, to restrict it to valid exits (eg "get out" from vehicles), which should make get messages work correctly again in both add_items and normal objects. Thanks to Limanoob for reporting the problem.

Thu Jul  3 07:40:17 2003: Loriel added a clear_tell_history() function to /secure/user/history.c and amended /cmds/player/tell.c to call this, so "tell /clear" should now work as advertised. Thanks to Zen for reporting this.

Sat Oct 11 12:45:18 2003: Loriel amended FTP_CMD_port() in FTP_D (/secure/daemons/ftp_d.c) to use the public address instead of private address where these differ.

Sat Oct 18 05:09:52 2003: Loriel amended ANSI_D (/daemons/ansi_d.c) and /obj/admtool/daemons/colour.c to support "wizard-only" configurable colours, and amended /cmds/player/colours.c to ignore them for non-wizards.
