Mudlib Features:
 o Centralized natural language parsing (zork like commands for players).
 o Socials use the natural language parsing, and are easy to extend.
	(The soul is *huge*).
 o Wizards have featureful shells including full unix globbing (ls *.[ch]),
	command piping / redirection, etc...
 o Inline documentation.	
 o Distributed support.
 o Very modular, with clear code.
 o Support for Intermud-3.
 o Modal input, and fully featured interactive shells.
 o Real, secure security authored by Ellery @ TMI-2 (Reimer Behrends).
 o Emphasis on player usability:
	better news, channels, menus, etc...
	than any other mudlib
 o Easy to build menus, easy to write socials, etc...
 o A menu driven admin tool to ease routine administration tasks.
