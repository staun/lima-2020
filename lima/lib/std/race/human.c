 * These are the bonuses for the derived statistics.  If this is zero, the

 * is scaled into that range.
 *
 * For example, consider a race with a racial con bonus of 50.
 * 
 * The derived constitution is a weighted average of 3 base stats.  This
 * gives a number in the range [0..100].  The racial bonus says that that
 * number should be adjusted into the range [50..100].  This has three effects:
 *
 * (1) All members of the race will have at least 50 constitution.
 * (2) 100 is the max for all races.
 * (3) Races that start out with a bonus advance slower (since the range is
 *     compressed).  For example, if your base stats go up by 10, then your
 *     con would only increase by 5.
