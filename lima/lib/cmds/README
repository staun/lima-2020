This is the directory for commands that don't do things that might be
a security violation.  
The Cmd_rules file that exists in some directories is used to tell the
mudlib which wizard commands are to receive special processing.  
If you're writing new commands, you don't have to worry about this
file unless you understand it.  Just follow any of the commands in
/cmds/player as a template.
