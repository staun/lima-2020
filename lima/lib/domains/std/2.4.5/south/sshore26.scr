  You are standing on the shore of Crescent Lake, a beautiful and\n
  clear lake. Out in the centre of the lake stands the Isle\n
  of the Magi.\n
  A trail leads into the forest to the north.\n
  The shore of Crescent Lake continues northeast and northwest\n
  To the southeast, a stone bridge used to cross over to the\n
  Isle of the Magi, but it has fallen into the lake, making the\n
  crossing to the island impossible by that means.  However, you can\n
  make out the faint outline of a magical bridge its place.
