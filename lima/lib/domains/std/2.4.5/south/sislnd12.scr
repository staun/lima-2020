  You are standing on the shore of the Isle of the Magi\n
  The shore of the island continues northeast to the ruined bridge\n
  and west into a small grove from here.\n
  To the south is a old, disused well.\n
  Standing atop a cliff to the southwest is the ruined tower of Arcanarton,\n
  but there is no way to get up there from here.\n
  A path does lead up the hill to the east though.
