Warning:

DON'T USE THIS AREA ON YOUR MUD!!!

This area is going to be used (ever so greatly changed) by a mud the LIMA guys are making.  We are providing this area as an example only!  You can use the code to the extent that you want to code something similar by example, but otherwise, get your own ideas =P

As for this area, if you want to play it before you read the code, there are nine rooms and a treasure to find.  See if you can do it...
