  The Grand Hall, the meeting place for Lima Wizards, is a large room with 
  polished wooden floorboards, and rough hewn beams overhead. A narrow flight 
  of stairs lead upwards, their top splashed by flickering blue light, while 
  an equally narrow flight leads downwards into the gloom. Two rocky passages 
  leave the room. The northwest one is warm and sulfurous, while the south 
  passage smells faintly malodorous, as though something had died in the 
  recent past.

  A low doorway in the east wall allows access to the example room, a glowing 
  portal in the north wall leads to the mortal start area, and to the west is 
  the quiet room.  Its door is currently $oak_door.
