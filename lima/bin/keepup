#!/bin/bash
# A bash script to keep the mud up by looking at ps and seeing if
# the driver or startmud script is going, and if it isn't, then
# it invokes that command.  This is meant to be called from your
# machines cron system, so you should add an entry to your crontab
# 0,30 * * * * ~/bin/keepup
# which will check every 30 minutes to see if your mud is still up.
# grep is probably not the best way to check, a regexp is probably
# better, but I figure your executable name should be long and fairly unique if
# you invoke with the full path name, and I'd prefer this to be easily
#portable between shells, and rexexp syntax differs between shells.

#Redistribute freely, as usual

#
# Modify these as necessary
